This is a chess game playable in your console.

run the engine to start a game

(Note: depending on your background color the pieces may have inverted colors)
How to play:
The white pieces always begin, to move them you need to type the current
location of the piece you want to move in your console. (e.g. a2 or G2 or b1)
If there is a piece you need to write the location you want to move the piece to.
If the location is not reachable for the piece or your king would be in check, 
you need to pick a piece again first.

You perform a castle by selecting the king and moving him to the desired position,
the rook will be placed automatically at the right position.

If a pawn can be promoted, you are asked what piece he should get exchanged with by 
writing the number 1,2,3 or 4 into the console



functions not included: - a trigger to end the game if someone won
			 - a trigger to end the game on remi
			 
if someone won the other person is still able to write moves but they won't be executed
because their king would still be in check, effectively softlocking the game state
